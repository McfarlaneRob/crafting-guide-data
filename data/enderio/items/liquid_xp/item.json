{"description":"Liquid XP is used for storage and transference of XP. Depending on the mods in use there are various ways of acquiring it but an easy method is to use an experience obelisk from EnderIO (mod), then pipe the XP from this to a tank. Alternatively, use an XP Vacuum and extract from that, however, it will need a bucket of liquid XP to activate initially."}
